# flutter_chat_app

Here you see a peer to peer chat app! That means you can send messages to your friends directly - without servers, there is nothing that could be danger to you privacy. Only you and your friends. No logs, no moderators, but full privacy!

## How to use it
### web
You can go to https://flutter-chat-jp843lrd9-ilya6370s-projects.vercel.app/ which is a web deployed version that already works.
### androis
There are currently several issues about sending images from android apk application, but if you download chrome-powered application(I mean PWA) right from the web version, it will be just as good as apk.
Apk will be posted in "releases when it's ready"
### windows
The build is ready and stable, soon it will be posted in "releases", But you can download the PWA app from web as well
